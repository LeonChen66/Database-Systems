# Database-Systems

##### Course Description. 

This course is a “second” course in database systems. It studies the principle and implementation of database management systems. We assume that students are familiar in principle with basic knowledge of the functional aspects of databases and database programming (e.g., chapters 2-10 in the textbook). A general understanding of the course also assumes familiarity with undergraduate-level data structures and algorithms (e.g. CSCE-411).
We will start with a quick review of the fundamentals of database design and database devel- opment (i.e., chapters 1-10 in the textbook). We then concentrate on more detailed discussions on the following topics (basically, chapters 13-19, if time permits also chapters 20 and 22, in the textbook):  

• system architecture and file structure  
• efficient data manipulation using indexing and hashing; • query processing  
• crash recovery  
• concurrency control  
• transaction processing  
• database security and integrity  
• bigdata  
• distributed databases and data mining (if time permits)
